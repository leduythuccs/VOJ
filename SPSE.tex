Professor Spook is consulting for NASA, which is planning a series of space shuttle flights and must decide which commercial experiments to perform and which instruments to have on board each flight. For each flight NASA considers a set \textbf{E = \{E$_1$, E$_2$, ..., E$_m$\}} of instruments experiments and the commercial sponsor of \textbf{E$_j$} has agreed to pay NASA \textbf{p$_j$} dollars for the results of the experiments.

The experiments use a set \textbf{I = \{I$_1$, I$_2$, ..., I$_n$\}} of instruments; each experiment \textbf{E$_j$} requires some of the instruments from the set. The cost of carrying instruments \textbf{I$_k$} is \textbf{c$_k$} dollars. And an instrument can be used for multiple experiments.

The professor's job is to determine which experiments to perform and which instruments to carry for a given flight in order to maximize the net revenue, which is the total income from the experiments performed minus the total cost of the instruments carried. Since he is not a programmer, he asked your help.

\section{Input}

Input starts with an integer \textbf{T (}\textbf{≤ 100)}, denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing two integers \textbf{m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000)} and \textbf{n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), }where \textbf{m} denotes the number of experiments and \textbf{n} denotes the number of instruments. The next line contains \textbf{m} space separated integers, where the \textbf{j$^th$} integer denotes the commercial sponsor of \textbf{E$_j$} paying NASA \textbf{p$_j $(1 ≤ p$_j$ ≤ 10000)} dollars for the result of the experiment. The next line contains \textbf{n} space separated integers, where the \textbf{k$^th$} integer denotes the cost of carrying the \textbf{k$^th$} instrument, \textbf{c$_k $(1 ≤ c$_k$ ≤ 10000)}. Each of the next \textbf{m} lines contains an integer \textbf{q$_i$ (1 ≤ q$_i$ ≤ n)} followed by \textbf{q$_i$} distinct integers each between \textbf{1} and \textbf{n}, separated by spaces. These \textbf{q$_i$} integers denote the required instruments for the \textbf{i$^th$} experiment.

\section{Output}

For each case, print the case number and the maximum revenue NASA can make using the experiments.
