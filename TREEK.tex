   Given two integers n and k. Count the number of different trees such that:  

   - Tree has exactly n nodes.  

   - Each node has 0 or 2 chlidren.  

   - Tree's height is exactly k.  

   Note:  

   - An empty tree is same as an empty tree  

   - tree X is same as tree Y if and only if the left subtree of X is same as the left subtree of Y and the right subtree of X is same as the right subtree of Y.  

\subsubsection{   Input  }

   Two integers n and k, inclusive.  

\subsubsection{   Output  }

   The number of trees in modulo 9901.
