Farmer John has lined up his N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) cows in a row to measure their heights; cow i has height H\_i (1 ≤ H\_i ≤ 1,000,000,000) nanometers--FJ believes in precise measurements! He wants to take a picture of some contiguous subsequence of the cows to submit to a bovine photography contest at the county fair.   

    The fair has a very strange rule about all submitted photos: a photograph is only valid to submit if it depicts a group of cows whose median height is at least a certain threshold X (1 ≤ X ≤ 1,000,000,000).   

    For purposes of this problem, we define the median of an array A[0...K] to be A[ceiling(K/2)] after A is sorted, where ceiling(K/2) gives K/2 rounded  up to the nearest integer (or K/2 itself, it K/2 is an integer to begin with). For example the median of \{7, 3, 2, 6\} is 6, and the median of \{5, 4, 8\} is 5.   

    Please help FJ count the number of different contiguous subsequences of his cows that he could potentially submit to the photography contest.
