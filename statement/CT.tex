   Consider a 2D integer grid with lower left corner at (0, 0) and upper right corner at (X, Y). We are interested in isosceles right triangles which all the 3 corners at the grid node (integer coordinates). Your task is to count the number of those triangles.  




   Input   


   The input begins with C â€“ number of test cases.   


   Each test case consists of X, Y.  




   Output   


   For each test case, output the result in a line.  




   Limits   


   C  $\le$  20   


   0  $\le$  X, Y  $\le$  1000
